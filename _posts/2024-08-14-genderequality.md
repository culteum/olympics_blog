## Introduction

The 2024 Paris Olympics marked a significant milestone in the history of sports, as it became the first Olympic Games to achieve equal representation of male and female athletes. This achievement, highlighted by UN Women, is a critical step forward in promoting gender equality, breaking traditional barriers, and setting a new standard for future international competitions. As the world celebrated this landmark event, a deeper analysis of the data reveals the successes and challenges faced by individual countries like France and the United States in their pursuit of gender equality in sports.

This article follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to explore key questions related to gender representation, medal performance, and the impact of these factors on achieving gender equality goals in the Olympics. We will compare France and the USA, focusing on their performance at the 2024 Paris Olympics and their historical trends.

## Business Understanding

The primary objectives of this analysis are to evaluate and compare gender equality in the Olympic teams of France and the USA. The key questions addressed include:

How did the representation of female athletes in the 2024 Paris Olympics compare to previous Games for both France and the USA?
Which sports saw the most significant female participation and success in the 2024 Paris Olympics for both countries?
How does the medal performance of female athletes in 2024 compare to that of male athletes in France and the USA?
Which sports have shown consistent gender participation over the decades, and where have declines been observed?
Did France and the USA meet their gender equality goals in the 2024 Olympics?
Data Understanding

This analysis leverages several datasets, including historical Olympic data spanning over 120 years, data from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, and updated datasets from the 2024 Paris Olympics. These datasets provide detailed information on athlete participation, medals won, and gender distribution across various sports and countries.

## Data Preparation

To ensure accuracy, the data was cleaned and standardized, focusing on gender labels, medals, and years. Inconsistencies in gender representation (e.g., 'M' vs. 'Male') were resolved, and the data was merged to allow for comprehensive comparisons across different Olympic Games.

## Modeling and Analysis

1. Representation of Female Athletes in the 2024 Paris Olympics
The analysis began by examining the gender distribution in the Olympic teams of France and the USA for 2024. For France, female athletes made up 37.7% of the team, while male athletes constituted 62.3%. This indicates that while progress has been made, France did not fully meet its gender equality objectives.

In contrast, the USA demonstrated a stronger commitment to gender equality, with female athletes accounting for 51% of their Olympic team. This aligns with the global achievement of gender parity at the 2024 Paris Olympics, highlighting the USA's leadership in promoting gender equality in sports.

2. Sports with Significant Female Participation and Success
A closer look at the sports in which women participated in 2024 revealed key areas of success for both France and the USA. In France, Cycling Road, Athletics, and Judo were among the sports with the highest female participation and contributed significantly to the total medals won by women.

For the USA, women excelled in Swimming, Track and Field, and Gymnastics, with these sports accounting for a substantial portion of the countryâ€™s total medal count. The USA's success was particularly notable, with more than half of its medals being won by female athletes, underscoring their critical role in the nation's overall Olympic success.

3. Medal Performance of Female Athletes in 2024
In 2024, female athletes from France won approximately 37.7% of the country's medals, while in the USA, female athletes contributed to over 50% of the total medal count. This significant contribution highlights the importance of female athletes in driving the success of both countries at the Games.

When comparing the specific sports contributing to this success, Cycling and Athletics were standout areas for France, while Swimming and Gymnastics were dominant for the USA. These findings emphasize the critical role these sports play in advancing gender equality in Olympic performance.

4. Consistency and Declines in Gender Participation Over Decades
The analysis also examined gender participation trends over the decades, identifying sports that had either consistent or declining female participation. Gymnastics and Athletics have shown consistent female participation across decades in both France and the USA. However, sports such as Weightlifting and Boxing have seen declines in female representation, raising important questions about the factors contributing to decreased participation in these sports.

These declining trends suggest areas where more support and encouragement may be needed to reverse the decline and promote greater gender equality in sports participation.

5. Meeting Gender Equality Goals in the 2024 Olympics
The final aspect of the analysis focused on whether France and the USA met their gender equality goals in the 2024 Olympics. While the USA successfully achieved gender parity, with women making up a majority of their Olympic team, France fell short of this goal. The gender distribution in France's 2024 Olympic team showed that male athletes outnumbered female athletes, indicating that while progress has been made, further efforts are needed to achieve full gender equality in future competitions.

## Evaluation

The findings from this analysis provide a comprehensive understanding of gender equality in sports, particularly in the context of the 2024 Paris Olympics. While the USA has made significant strides in promoting gender equality, France still faces challenges in achieving full gender parity in its Olympic team. The analysis also highlights the importance of specific sports in driving female participation and success, offering insights into where further efforts may be needed to support gender equality in sports.

## Conclusion

The 2024 Paris Olympics marked a historic moment for gender equality in sports, with the global achievement of equal representation of male and female athletes. However, the journey toward true gender equality is ongoing, as evidenced by the varying levels of female participation and success across different countries and sports.

France's experience at the 2024 Games illustrates both the progress made and the challenges that remain in achieving gender parity. While the country made significant strides, the analysis reveals that more work is needed to ensure equal representation and support for female athletes across all sports.

In contrast, the USA's success in achieving gender parity and the substantial contribution of female athletes to their overall medal count demonstrate the positive impact of gender equality initiatives. As we look to the future, the lessons learned from the 2024 Paris Olympics will be crucial in guiding efforts to promote gender equality in sports, ensuring that the achievements of today pave the way for even greater progress in the years to come.
